# Selenium-tests
Here I am planning to upload all my pytest and selenium tests for a lot of different websites.
Each website is made for sole purpose of being tested automatically. 

### Install

1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Run tests(CMD and terminal)

pytest test_test_ultimate_qa.py

### Description

test_ultimate_qa.py is testing website https://ultimateqa.com/simple-html-elements-for-automation which is more about different approaches for finding elements. On top
of that it verifies if tester can handle radio buttons, checkboxes, menu dropdowns and tabs. The last test is login site, but sometimes it forces a captcha.
